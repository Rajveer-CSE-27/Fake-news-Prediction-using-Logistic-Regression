Fake News Prediction Model - README

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning model that predicts whether a news article is fake or real.

Overview

The spread of misinformation through fake news has become a major societal concern. This model aims to address this issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to identify fake news articles based on their textual content.

Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn (or other machine learning libraries)
nltk (for text pre-processing)
Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of news articles, where each article is categorized as either "real" or "fake." :

Disclaimer

It is important to note that machine learning models are not perfect, and the accuracy of this model will depend on various factors. This model should not be used as the sole source of truth for identifying fake news. It is crucial to exercise critical thinking and consult multiple sources before drawing conclusions about the veracity of information.
